## ALBA Expansion Packages

ALBA is an awesome Laravel boilerplate application. This repository contains the expansion packages that make up Alba. If you are starting a new Alba-based project then you should start by forking the [Alba Boilerplate](http://github.com/emersonmedia/Alba-Boilerplate) repository which includes this repository as a Composer dependency.

* [Alba\Core](http://github.com/emersonmedia/Alba/tree/master/src/Alba/Core): foundational package for other expansion packages
* [Alba\Build](http://github.com/emersonmedia/Alba/tree/master/src/Alba/Build): asset management expansion package integrated with Gulp JS
* [Alba\User](http://github.com/emersonmedia/Alba/tree/master/src/Alba/User): user management expansion package with role-based permissions

> **Notice:** _This code is specifically designed to be compatible with the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com) and may not be compatible as a stand-alone dependency or as part of another framework._
