ALBA Core Modules & Components
===

ALBA is an awesome Laravel boilerplate application. This repository contains the base components that make up Alba. If you are starting a new Alba-based project then you should start by forking the [Alba Boilerplate](http://github.com/emersonmedia/Alba-Boilerplate) repository which includes this repository as a Composer dependency.

**Notice:** _This code is specifically designed to be compatible with the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com) and may not be compatible as a stand-alone dependency or as part of another framework._
